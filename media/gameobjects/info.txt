
How to add Models to Level Editor Program.
------------------------------------------

This directory structure is tightly conected to program functionality.
If you add another directory here - new tab will appear in LevelEditor -> GameObject window.
If you delete one of existing dirs, their tab will simply dissapear from GameObject window.
Inside these dirs program is looking for xml file with same name as dir (in directory Static it looks for Static.xml).
These xml files contain available model files structured in a tree. Xml file is read and tree of models is generated like this:

-Animals
	-turtle
	-sheep
	-bird
-Humanoids
	-dwarf
	-combold
	-zombie
+Dragons
+Other

Program doesn't accutaly check if the model is present at this time, it just loads what is in the xml file. 
If appropriate model is not there, warning will fire when model is selected in the program, and thats all.

If you want to add new models to this LevelEditor simply add models name in xml file and save model in appropriate dir.
For example, if you want to add animated model of rat to program, it would be best to put it in Monsters->Animals category to be with it's friends.
Enter Monsters dir and open Monsters.xml, you'll see something like this:
<Config>
	<Animals>
		<Monsters filename="turtle"/>
		<Monsters filename="bird"/>
		<Monsters filename="sheep"/>
	</Animals>
If you models name is Ratsy.x you would add it like this:
 <Config>
	<Animals>
		<Monsters filename="turtle"/>
		<Monsters filename="bird"/>
		<Monsters filename="sheep"/>
		<Monsters filename="Ratsy"/>
	</Animals>
Put the Ratsy.x file in Monsters/Animals folder and all it's textures should be in there too.

Try not to make any unnecessary new folder in Monsters dir (like 'rats_leg_textures') cause it will be added as new tree node category.
If you want to add new tree node category, for example "Furniture" under Static category, 
you go to Static dir, create new dir Furniture, and to Static.xml file add <Furniture> </Furniture> tags.
Then between those tags add new models <Static filename="new_model"> and don't forget to copy them to Furniture dir.

All your changes will be present in next start of the program without recompiling, building or anything.

Oh, yeah, one more thing: no sub sub dirs. Only one level of node parenting is supported. If you add new dir under Animals, like 
Monsters/Animals/Flying, that won't work badly. Just don't do it for now. Better add it beside Animals like FlyingAnimals if you like.
<Config>
	<Animals>
		<Flying>
			<Monsters filename="THIS IS NO GOOD BECAUSE OF SUBDIRING SUBDIR">
		</Flying>
	</Animals>
	<FlyingAnimals>
		<Monsters filename="THIS WILL WORK NO PROBLEMO">
	</FlyingAnimals>
</Config>	

-- TO BE CHANGED -- Notice there is no .x extension after "Ratsy", and uppercase R must be same as filename. 
Program will load any model extension supported by irrlicht. Don't call your texture Ratsy.jpg cause it can cause 
error in loading model. Call it somthing that doesn't contain "Ratsy" like Rat_tex.jpg.

Finally, after model is working properly in the program, you can add properties to it using Ratsy.xml file, 
that is xml file with the same name as your model. Program will automaticly load properties from xml file with the same name
(so don't name your model "Static" or "Monsters" or anything already existing), and those properties should look like this:

<Config>
	<Container value="true"/>
	<Invisible value="false"/>
</Config>
