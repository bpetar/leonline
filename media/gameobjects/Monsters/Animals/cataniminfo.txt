Assuming the first frame is 1, then the anim ranges are as follows!!

2-14 = walk anim

16-59 = idle anim

You might have to remove one frame off the end if it doesn't loop perfectly (cus the first and last frames are the same)

If you use this model credits would be nice but arent essential!!
