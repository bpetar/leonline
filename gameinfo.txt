
Game Example
------------

This game is example of how levels created in level editor behave in point and click kind of game.
If you start the game you will see one very simple level with few game objects for demonstration.

You character is little green turtle.
Use your mouse to click on the ground and turtle will walk to that position.
If you click on some object, turtle will approach and try to interact with it.
Check little console for text info.
To adjust the camera position, press and hold (and move) right mouse button.
Use mouse scroll to change camera distance.
You can use items in your inventory with right mouse click.
You can save/load game (it makes sense if you make bigger levels)

If you make your own levels in level editor, you can tell game example to load them by modifying game_config.xml
Attribute "MapStart" points to the first level loaded by the game, and if you have more, list all your levels in <Maps> tag.
