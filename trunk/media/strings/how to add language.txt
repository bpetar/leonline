
Adding Languages
----------------

If you want to add another language, take en_strings.xml and translate it.
New language needs a name and two letter unique identification for example: 

name="French" value="fr"

File must be named using two letter identifier for example: fr_strings.xml.

Language will automatically appear in game preferences, and if chosen, translated strings will appear in the game. If you don't translate all strings, default one will be used in case of missing strings.
