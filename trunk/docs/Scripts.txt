Best is to open some other scrips and see how they look like.
Here is piece of script used when player tries to play flute:

<Script>
	<OnUse> 
    <Condition attribute="PLAYER_KNOWS_HOW_TO_PLAY_FLUTE" value="0">
      <InfoGUI value="You don't know how to play flute" />
    </Condition>
	</OnUse>
</Script>

This simple example shows ECA (Event Condition Action) nesting.
Event is OnUse. It is called when player right clicks on Flute in his inventory. Hes trying to play it.
Condition PLAYER_KNOWS_HOW_TO_PLAY_FLUTE is initially defined as false (0).
Action InfoGui just displays message on the screen.

You don't want to write scripts by hand. Just open gui in level editor.
