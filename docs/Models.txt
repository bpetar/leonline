------------

.3ds 

- model needs to have material name 3 letters long.
- texture name should only be 3 letters long + extension.
- 3ds model loaded to irrlicht has 3 normals for each vertex - unable to do smooth shading.

.x

- specular material component color need to be set to something neutral grey.
- specular and difuse intensity in blender must be 1.
- Ctrl + A, need to apply rot/scale/translate transformation before exporting to fix normals.
- if model has two textures, there should be two materials, and two vertex groups.
- we need to explicitly click Assign in edit mode to assign material to selected vertices.
